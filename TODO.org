* Deployment script
  
* Ansible global configuration
  
- Run tools stopping servers from the login node. No need to ssh the first
  storage node to run it.

* Data managers

** BeeGFS
- Dynamically create inventory file with groups per service. Meta-nodes,
  storage-nodes, etc...
- BeeGFS scripts (/opt/beegfs/etc...) as variables in tasks: make those
  variables global
- Move client_mount_point from roles/client/vars to make it a user-defined variable
- Fix version of Debian for the BeeGFS container 
- Use containerized BeeGFS tool (beegfs-ctl ?) to stop all the services
  instead of killing them

** MinIO
- Auto-generate keys (access, secret)
- 

** Cassandra
- Autogenerate username/password for improved security
- Add a task to sleep during the joining process (30000 ms according to the
  log)
- Clean up YAML files. Too many hard-coded values
